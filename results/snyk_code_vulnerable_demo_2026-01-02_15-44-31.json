These commands can then be executed on the application server, potentially leading to harmful consequences, including data exposure or deletion. Like code injection attacks, command injection attacks are essentially a failure of data validation. Unlike code injection attacks, which introduce new code, command injection attacks use existing system functions, often taking advantage of the application's unnecessarily high privilege level, increasing the risk of serious harm and reputational damage.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never trust user input. Assume any input may transmit harmful values.\n- Adopt the principle of least privilege: No application should have a greater access level than needed to run its required tasks.\n- Control user access policies on a task-by-task basis.\n- Don't pass user input directly to the system; use libraries or APIs that lack system access.\n- Where shell commands must be passed, escape values using functions like shlex for Python, or escapeshellarg() for PHP.\n- Sanitize user input with regular expressions to define permitted characters along with maximum string length.\n- Convert special characters such as `& |  ; $ > < \\ !` before passing to the server.\n- Whitelist permitted commands and validate user responses against these expectations.\n- Remember that code injection can take place on multiple fronts: GET and POST requests, but also cookies and HTTP headers.\n- Ensure up-to-date patching across all systems to remediate known vulnerabilities.\n- Educate all team members on safer data handling procedures to prevent attacks.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part of popular protocols like _Remote Method Invocation (RMI)_, _Java Management Extension (JMX)_, _Java Messaging System (JMS)_, _Action Message Format (AMF)_, _Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState_, etc.\n\n_Deserialization of untrusted data_ ([CWE-502](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)), is when the application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control the state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library (Apache Commons Collection)](https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSCOLLECTIONS-30078). These classes were used in zero-days affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\n\nAn attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the deserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n\n> Developers put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even de-serialize objects pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object in Java you typically cast it to an expected type, and therefore Java's strict type system will ensure you only get valid object trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking happens, platform code has already created and executed significant logic. So, before the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the developer's control. By combining the readObject() methods of various classes which are available on the classpath of the vulnerable application an attacker can execute functions (including calling Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA cross-site scripting attack occurs when the attacker tricks a legitimate web-based application or site to accept a request as originating from a trusted source.\n\nThis is done by escaping the context of the web application; the web application then delivers that data to its users along with other trusted dynamic content, without validating it. The browser unknowingly executes malicious script on the client side (through client-side languages; usually JavaScript or HTML)  in order to perform actions that are otherwise typically blocked by the browser's Same Origin Policy.\n\nInjecting malicious code is the most prevalent manner by which XSS is exploited; for this reason, escaping characters in order to prevent this manipulation is the top method for securing code against this vulnerability.\n\nEscaping means that the application is coded to mark key characters, and particularly key characters included in user input, to prevent those characters from being interpreted in a dangerous context. For example, in HTML, `<` can be coded as  `&lt`; and `>` can be coded as `&gt`; in order to be interpreted and displayed as themselves in text, while within the code itself, they are used for HTML tags. If malicious content is injected into an application that escapes special characters and that malicious content uses `<` and `>` as HTML tags, those characters are nonetheless not interpreted as HTML tags by the browser if they've been correctly escaped in the application code and in this way the attempted attack is diverted.\n\nThe most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies (source: OWASP HttpOnly) and hijack user sessions, but XSS exploits have been used to expose sensitive information, enable access to privileged services and functionality and deliver malware.\n\n### Types of attacks\nThere are a few methods by which XSS can be manipulated:\n\n|Type|Origin|Description|\n|--|--|--|\n|**Stored**|Server|The malicious code is inserted in the application (usually as a link) by the attacker. The code is activated every time a user clicks the link.|\n|**Reflected**|Server|The attacker delivers a malicious link externally from the vulnerable web site application to a user. When clicked, malicious code is sent to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user's browser.|\n|**DOM-based**|Client|The attacker forces the user's browser to render a malicious page. The data in the page itself delivers the cross-site scripting data.|\n|**Mutated**| |The attacker injects code that appears safe, but is then rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters.|\n\n### Affected environments\nThe following environments are susceptible to an XSS attack:\n\n* Web servers\n* Application servers\n* Web application environments\n\n## Best practices for prevention\nThis section describes the top best practices designed to specifically protect your code:\n\n* Sanitize data input in an HTTP request before reflecting it back, ensuring all data is validated, filtered or escaped before echoing anything back to the user, such as the values of query parameters during searches.\n* Convert special characters such as `?`, `&`, `/`, `<`, `>` and spaces to their respective HTML or URL encoded equivalents.\n* Give users the option to disable client-side scripts.\n* Redirect invalid requests.\n* Detect simultaneous logins, including those from two separate IP addresses, and invalidate those sessions.\n* Use and enforce a Content Security Policy (source: Wikipedia) to disable any features that might be manipulated for an XSS attack.\n* Read the documentation for any of the libraries referenced in your code to understand which elements allow for embedded HTML.",

For example, if a breached authentication token is hardcoded in multiple places in the application, it may lead to components of the application remaining vulnerable if not all instances are changed.\nAnother negative effect of hard-coding constants is potential unpredictability in the application's performance if the development team fails to update every single instance of the hardcoded constant throughout the code. For these reasons, hard-coding security-relevant constants is considered bad coding practice and should be remedied if present and avoided in future.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n- Never hard code security-related constants; use symbolic names or configuration lookup files.\n- As hard coding is often done by coders working alone on a small scale, examine all legacy code components and test carefully when scaling.\n- Adopt a \"future-proof code\" mindset: While use of constants may save a little time now and make development simpler in the short term, it could cost time and money adapting to scale or other unforeseen circumstances (such as new hardware) in the future.",

                "markdown": "## Details\n\nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.\n\nBeing able to access and manipulate an arbitrary path leads to vulnerabilities when a program is being run with privileges that the user providing the path should not have. A website with a path traversal vulnerability would allow users access to sensitive files on the server hosting it. CLI programs may also be vulnerable to path traversal if they are being ran with elevated privileges (such as with the setuid or setgid flags in Unix systems).\n\nDirectory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:\n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.\n\n`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:st:20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.\n\nIf an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.\n\n```\ncurl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa\n```\n**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).\n\n- **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n```\n2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt\n2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```",

Attackers can then view, export, modify, and delete confidential information; change passwords and other authentication information; and possibly gain access to other systems within the network. This is one of the most commonly exploited categories of vulnerability, but can largely be avoided through good coding practices.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Avoid passing user-entered parameters directly to the SQL server.\n* Avoid using string concatenation to build SQL queries from user-entered parameters.\n* When coding, define SQL code first, then pass in parameters. Use prepared statements with parameterized queries. Examples include `SqlCommand()` in .NET and `bindParam()` in PHP.\n* Use strong typing for all parameters so unexpected user data will be rejected.\n* Where direct user input cannot be avoided for performance reasons, validate input against a very strict allowlist of permitted characters, avoiding special characters such as `? & / < > ; - ' \" \\` and spaces. Use a vendor-supplied escaping routine if possible.\n* Develop your application in an environment and/or using libraries that provide protection against SQL injection.\n* Harden your entire environment around a least-privilege model, ideally with isolated accounts with privileges only for particular tasks.",

This weakness is sometimes also known as **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**, since templates are one of the most common types of resources that suffer from this weakness.\nThese types of attacks differ from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which take place on the client side and are generally more easily detected. However, code that is vulnerable to XSS attacks may also be vulnerable to SSTI attacks, since they arise through similar design flaws. And similar to XSS and other injection-type attacks, SSTI attacks are relatively preventable through proactive planning and design during development.\n\n## Best practices for prevention\n* Take a preventative, zero-trust approach and implement safer methods of processing user-controllable input on pages issuing directives to the server.\n* Never pass incoming data directly to the server. Instead, sanitize and validate all incoming data from the client side, ideally checking it against an allowlist of valid actions and destinations (instead of just parsing for banned characters).\n* Select template engines that use sandboxing or allowlists to defend against the possibility of SSTI. However, keep in mind that these may have intrinsic weaknesses.\n* Test applications using lists of publicly available template expression test strings and problematic payloads for your PHP template engine.\n* Given the fallibility of parsing approaches and sandboxing, consider implementing complementary protection methods, such as kernel hardening and read-only filesystems.",
